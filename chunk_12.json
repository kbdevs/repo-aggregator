However, with the current dumping programs you will not get a complete bootrom and booting the OS will fail.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n* Multiple files can be sent in the Mobile UI and by dropping them into the main window on desktop (#279)\r\n Reimplemented emulation speed control: Now it's more accurate, especially on Windows\r\n* GitHub actions now performs automated builds for Android (armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a in one APK), macOS and Windows (32bit and 64bit) on releases and pull requests (#283, #284, #285)\r\n* The \"installer\" for OS 4.5.3.14 (and later?) works now. It requires [fastboot RAM](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=Memory-mapped_I/O_ports_on_CX#90030000_-_Fastboot_RAM) to persist state across reboots, which is now implemented.\r\n* More accurate emulation of the On button: It's now possible to enter Press-To-Test mode (#271)\r\n* Faster saving and loading of snapshots (#231)\r\n* More reliable USB file transfers\r\n* The debugger console now includes entered commands in the log\r\n* Support for PIE (position-independent executables) on x86_64. Previously, care needed to be taken that PIE was disabled, otherwise it would crash on start. (#211)\r\n* Building the JIT is disabled automatically if the platform does not support it (#197)\r\n* Firebird builds on FreeBSD now (#228, #248)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n* File access on Android got fixed (#202 and its various duplicates)\r\n* Fix placement of keypad buttons in the touchpad area (#41)\r\n* Various fixes for the Mobile UI layout (#201)\r\n* The kit configuration page in the Mobile UI no longer causes the keyboard to pop up by default (#257)\r\n* Connecting with GDB on windows works now (#259, #260)\r\n* Some shades of grey were not displayed properly when emulating pre-CX models (#270)\r\n* Fix crash on AArch64/arm64 when executing certain instructions\r\n* The keypad reacts to touch events in the desktop version as well now (#292, #293)\r\n* Some places were no longer translated correctly after the introduction of language switching in 1.5\r\n* Keys could get stuck on focus changes. Now they're all released when the keypad loses focus (#287)\r\n* The Ctrl key now changes color when pressed\r\n* Emulation speed no longer remains unlimited after a failed file transfer\r\n\r\n_Repo for Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE: [via OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVogtinator%3Afirebird-emu&package=firebird-emu&locale=en)._\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress to implement and improve support for running in the browser on Qt for WebAssembly (#294).

Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* \ud83c\udfa8 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* \ud83d\udcf1 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* \u2764\ufe0f A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.",

      "localizedDescription": "Classic Gaming, Meet iOS.\n\nWhile iPhone and iOS have brought a new era of gaming upon us, there will always be room in our hearts for those classic games from decades ago. Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!",

Apps in the DOS days are often simpler and surprisingly productive.\n\nKEYBOARD\n\niDOS provides a PC compatible on-screen keyboard with carefully designed layouts for different devices and orientations. The keyboard has a sliding control in landscape mode so that you can keep it from covering critical part of the screen.\n\nBluetooth keyboard is partially supported. We support ESC, function keys, and ordinary CTRL and ALT key bindings. Unfortunately the arrow keys can't be used for game control. You should use a bluetooth game controller instead.\n\nGAMEPAD\n\niDOS provides a virtual gamepad with key bindings that are fairly common in DOS games. You can customize the bindings. The DPAD works in 8-axis way. It can also be toggled into a joystick.\n\nExternal bluetooth game controllers are supported. Make sure your game controller is connected (System Settings->Bluetooth). To customize button bindings, go to iDOS in landscape mode, tap on bluetooth icon on the auto-hiding top bar.\n\nMOUSE\n\n* The screen area serves as a trackpad for moving mouse pointer.\n* Tap on the screen for left click. If direct touch is enabled, the mouse pointer will move to where you tap.\n* Hold one finger on the screen, and tap with another finger for right click.\n* On-screen mouse buttons are also provided for your convenience.\n* Bluetooth mice are only partially supported.\n\nSUPPORT\n\n- Visit https://litchie.com/dospad for more information.\n- Send email to idos@litchie.com\n- Follow the developer on Twitter: https://twitter.com/litchiedev\n- iDOS is open source, report issues on https://github.com/litchie/dospad",

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices. However, some machines do not support this configuration, so now two units per bus will only be enabled for supported machines. Other machines will retain pre v4.3.1 behaviour.\r\n* Fixed some state tracking issues leading to various errors when a VM is quickly stopped and started again.\r\n* Changed the style of the icons on various VM operations in the home screen and context menu (iOS) (thanks @jnsdrtlf) (#5441, #4759)\r\n* Fixed an issue where serial device hardware was not saved\r\n* Fixed the error that shows up when trying to rename a VM (#5444)\r\n* Fixed a crash on startup due to mishandling of VM parsing (#5424)\r\n* Fixed debug logging not working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* Fixed a crash when QEMU tries to output non-printable characters\r\n* Add support for SWTPM for TPM 2.0 emulation\r\n* Add Secure Boot firmware for ARM64. Only the Secure Boot firmwares have TPM 2.0 support built in, so when TPM 2.0 and UEFI are enabled, UTM will automatically select the Secure Boot firmware. By default the UTM platform keys and Microsoft key exchange keys are enrolled. You can manually set up your own keys from the UEFI menu.\r\n* Updated the EDK2 UEFI firmware to the 202305 release\r\n* Debug logs will no longer be deleted when a VM configuration is saved and debug log is not disabled\r\n* Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor stopped working due to backend changes in v4.3.1\r\n* If the Documents directory does not exist in UTM's container, it will now be created automatically. This addresses an error that shows up if the Documents directory does not get created properly by macOS. (#5419)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed an issue where TSO setting was not saved\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where every time a VM is started with a terminal window, the width of the window gets a bit larger\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where starting a stopped VM does not change the display scale\r\n* (macOS) AVM: System keys will be captured automatically when entering full screen and released when exiting full screen (#3668)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Fixed the request stop method in both the GUI and scripting interfaces (#5425)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.1)\r\n* Updated QEMU backend to v8.0.2\r\n* Refactored QEMU support to a new project: [QEMUKit](https://github.com/utmapp/QEMUKit)\r\n* Machines with IDE interface (i44FX/PIIX) will now support two units per bus. Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility. You can choose to opt-in to this new mapping by pressing the \u201cUpdate Interface\u201d button on each IDE drive in the VM settings.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write.

          "localizedDescription": "This is the same release as v4.1.5 but with the change to default enable GPU acceleration for Linux reverted. This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856).

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

          "localizedDescription": "## Highlights\r\n* **Multiple display and headless display is now supported for QEMU machines.** You can configure 0 or more displays as well as 0 or more builtin terminal consoles. On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spainish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

          "localizedDescription": "## Installation\r\n**iOS**: Visit [https://getutm.app/install/][1] for the most up to date installation instructions.\r\n**macOS**: Download \"UTM.dmg\" below and copy the contents to your `/Applications` directory.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU 7.0.0**: The backend has been updated to the latest release. Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10) or [this guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04) for Ubuntu install issues.\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x. After that, iOS 14+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.4)\r\n* Fixed isolated network mode with new vmnet backend (#4022)\r\n* Fixed some USB devices not showing up for USB capture (#3975)\r\n* (iOS) Added tap to click with Apple Pencil (thanks @luken11)\r\n* (macOS) Workaround a SwiftUI freeze then crash in the home view when the scrollbar is visible (#3612)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an error loading Apple Virtualization VMs after updating from macOS 11 to macOS 12 (#4023)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed secondary click using Control+Click on the VM list (#4018)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.3)\r\n* Disabled screenshots for GL virtual machines (workaround for a crash that occurs, this will be re-enabled in a future update once the crash is triaged)\r\n* (iOS) Pass through Esc key on external keyboard when VoiceOver is in use (#3940)\r\n* (macOS) Use correct scaling when HiDPI is enabled (#3968)\r\n* (macOS) Fix toolbar overlapping top of screen when \"Automatically hide and show the menu bar in full screen\" is unchecked in system preferences (#3919)\r\n* (macOS) When bridged networking is selected, default the interface to \"en0\" (#3945)\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: clarify that Linux kernel and initrd must be uncompressed if Apple Virtualization is used\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.2)\r\n* Add \"disposable mode\" (see highlights for more information) (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n* Do not enable UEFI for unsupported architectures (#3976)\r\n* Fix broken play button in sidebar (#3980)\r\n* Fix \"Error -1 while loading VM state\" on resume caused by usbredir (#3979)\r\n* Various UI tweaks and typo fixes (#3984)\r\n* Fixed pausing without saving state\r\n* Fixed showing warning prompt when VM is paused but not saved\r\n* (iOS) Detect if UTM is installed without AltStore and AltJIT will not attempt to be used.\r\n* (iOS) Reduced build size by 10% (thanks @Halo-Michael) (#3934)\r\n* (macOS) Add new preference option to revert Caps Lock behaviour to pre 3.2.0 (#3974)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.2.1)\r\n* Fixed boot of RISC-V virt platform (thanks @wegank)\r\n* Remove `highmem=off` default property which is no longer needed on macOS 12.4+ and iOS 15.5+ (it will still be used on lower versions) (#3941, #3946)\r\n* Caps lock state will now be synchronized when mouse is captured (note that if mouse is captured before the guest OS has booted up, the state will be out of sync) (#3415)\r\n* Re-introduce option to disable auto-resolution when SPICE tools is installed (#3938)\r\n* When discarding unsaved settings, do not delete any disk image not created by UTM (#3587)\r\n* Fix downloading of UTM zip files when the URL does not end in \".zip\" (#3953)\r\n* (macOS) When importing a disk image, do not silently overwrite an existing image of the same name (#3866)\r\n* (macOS) Added option to reclaim unused space from disk image and to compress a disk image (macOS 12+ only)\r\n* (macOS) On the VM list, the start button will now change to a spinner when the VM is starting and will disappear when the VM has started.
